# Colors and Typography

## Overview

Applying your brand colors and typography to webcomponents requires a basic understanding of CSS.

If you're using a website theme created by someone else, it is helpful to understand how web browsers determine which styles are used. You can [learn about CSS specificity from MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity). In some cases, you may need to adapt our examples to be more "specific" than your website's CSS.

## Naming Conventions

Our webcomponents include classes most subelements to provide you with a concise way to select elements. We prefix all of our class names with `gspro-` to avoid conflicting with other class names from themes and frameworks. Although this makes things a little more verbose, our intention is to work well as many places as possible.

The default styles provided by our webcomponents attempt to be as minimially specific as possible so that the CSS you write is more succinct. The tradeoff is your website's existing CSS may override _our_ default styles; it's possible our examples won't work. So, being familiar with specificity rules is helpful.

## Item Card CSS

This example provides you with a handful of CSS selectors. Although they focus on colors, you can use these as a starting point to customize a variety of properties. You can easily [experiment with your own customizations](https://jsfiddle.net/goshujomo/j1xd8uos/) by forking this JSFiddle.

```
gspro-item-card {
  background: rgb(250, 250, 250);
}

gspro-item-card:hover {
  background: rgb(255, 255, 255);
}

gspro-item-card .gspro-o-card__title {
  color: #1F1F1F;
  white-space: nowrap;
  overflow: hidden;
  text-overflow: ellipsis
}

gspro-item-card .gspro-o-card__subtitle {
  color: #656565;
}

gspro-item-card .gspro-o-card__add button {
  background: #2A2A2A;
}

gspro-item-card .gspro-o-card__add:hover button {
  background: #1A1A1A;
}
```

## Item Detail CSS

```
gspro-item-detail .gspro-c-item-detail__title {
  color: black;
}

gspro-item-detail .gspro-c-item-detail__price {
  border: 1px solid black;
  color: black;
}
```

## Wishlist CSS

The wishlist has two different states. Initially, it is collapsed, appearing as a floating action button on the bottom-right side of the screen. When clicked, it will enter the expanded state.

This CSS shows you how to apply background and foreground colors in both states. If you use this snippet on your site, you might want to change the hotpink background to something that matches your site's branding.

```

gspro-wishlist[data-mode="collapse"] {
  background: white;
}

gspro-wishlist[data-mode="collapse"] .gspro-c-wishlist__count {
  background: black;
  color: white
}

gspro-wishlist[data-mode="collapse"] use {
  fill: black;
}

gspro-wishlist[data-mode="expand"] {
  background: hotpink;
}
```

## Button CSS

Some webcomponents have button elements. In order to make these look consistent in a variety of web browsers, devices, and operating systems; we provide a shape that makes them easy to select.

```
button.gspro-o-button {
  background: inherit;
}

button.gspro-o-button:hover {
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);
}

button.gspro-o-button--primary {
  background: #1F1F1F;
}

button.gspro-o-button-primary:hover {
  background: #3F3F3F;
}

button.gspro-o-button--warning {
  background: darkorange;
  color: white;
}

button.gspro-o-button--warning:hover {
  background: darkred;
  color: white;
}

button.gspro-o-button--reverse {
  background: white;
  color: hotpink;
}

button.gspro-o-button--reverse:hover {
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8);
  color: hotpink;
}

button.gspro-o-button--icon {
  background: inherit;
}

button.gspro-o-button--icon:hover {
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);
}

```

## Custom Properties

We are currently evaluating CSS custom properties. Please refrain from using any custom properties you may find in the markup generated by the webcomponents.
